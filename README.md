# NDVI
NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index) -  NDVI indicates whether the remotely-sensed target contains live green vegetation. 
Ever heard of multispectral images. These are images that are not standard RGB images but we can consider that these have extra dimensions. The extra dimensions like in satellite imgaes. 
When sunlight strikes objects, certain wavelengths of this spectrum are absorbed and other wavelengths are reflected. The pigment chlorophyll in plant leaves strongly absorbs visible light (with wavelengths in the range of 400-700 nm) for use in photosynthesis. Also plants reflect up to 60% more light in the near infrared portion of the spectrum than they do in the green portion of the spectrum. NDVI is a normalized measure of the difference between reflectance at near infrared and visible bands of the electromagnetic spectrum.
The formula for claculating NDVI is:
NDVI = (NIR-VIS)/(NIR+VIS)
where NIR = Near Infrared
and VIS = Visible band
